# Employee Burnout Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict employee burnout levels using Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning technique for regression tasks. Employee burnout is a significant issue affecting workplace productivity and morale. Predicting burnout levels can help organizations implement proactive measures to support their employees.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset sourced from [mention the dataset source], containing features such as workload, stress level, hours worked, etc., which are used to predict the burnout score.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-burnout-linear-regression.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd employee-burnout-linear-regression
   ```
   
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place your dataset file (e.g., `burnout_data.csv`) in the `data/` directory.
   - Update the data loading and preprocessing steps in `prepare_data.py` as per your dataset's structure.

2. **Training**:
   - Train the Linear Regression model by running:
     ```
     python train.py
     ```
   - Adjust hyperparameters or model configurations in `train.py` as needed.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Make predictions using the trained model:
     ```
     python predict.py
     ```
   - Ensure input data for prediction follows the format expected by `predict.py`.

## Results
- Evaluate the model's performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared score, etc.
- Visualize predictions versus actual burnout scores using Matplotlib if desired.
